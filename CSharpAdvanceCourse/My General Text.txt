// 7. Delegates

    >> A delegate is an object who knows how to call a method(or group of methods).
    >> A reference to a function.

    >> It needs for designing extensibe and flexible applications


//8. Lamda Expression

    >> An anonymous method
       > no access modefier
       > no name 
       > return statement

    >> We use it for convenince (writing less code to get the same result)


//9. Events
  
     >> A mechanism for communction between objects.
     >> Used for making loosely coupled applications.
     >> Help extending applications.


//10. Extension Methods

     >> It allows us to add methods to existing class without changing its source code
     >> or creating a new class that inherits to it.


//11. LINQ

     >> Language Integrated Query
     >> Giving you the capability of query objects


//12. Nullable Types

     >> completed


//13. Dynamic

     >> C# 4.0 (.NET 4.5) introduced a new type that avoids compile time type checking.
        It checks the type at runtime.


//14. Exception Handling

       >> completed


//15. Asynchronous Programming with Async/Await

       >> In Synchronous programming when a function is called the the program
          waits until the function returns to go to next line.

       >> In Asynchronous programming when a function is called, program execution
          continues ti the next line, without waiting for the function to complete.

       >> Real World Example : Windows Media Player, Web Browser

       >> WHEN we use ASynchronous Programming ?
            When:
                Accessing the Web
                Working with the files and databases
                Working with images
            HOW ??
            1. Traditional Approaches:
                Multi-threading
                Callbacks.
            2. New approach since .NET 4.5
                Async/ Await (Key Words)
