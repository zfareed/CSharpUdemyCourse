// 15. Variables and Constants

   >> completed lesson 15 where we talk about different type of variables and constants.
   >> some primitive data types are int, short, byte, long, float, double, decimal, char, bool.
   >> non-primitive data types are string, array, enum, class


// 16. Overflowing

   >> In this section we learn about the concept of overflowing.
   >> Every data type has its range for storing the numbers.
   >> If we store a number that not comes in its range then it will overflow.
   >> We also learn how to control overflowing.


// 17. Scope

   >> evry variable and constant has its scope where it is accessable
   >> It is not accessable form out of its scope
